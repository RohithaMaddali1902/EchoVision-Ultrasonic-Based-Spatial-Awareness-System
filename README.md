# EchoVision – Ultrasonic-Based Spatial Awareness System

## Project Description
EchoVision is an Arduino-based ultrasonic radar system designed to detect objects and visualize their position in real time. By combining an ultrasonic sensor, servo motor, and Processing-based graphical interface, the system provides a radar-style view for spatial awareness applications.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno  
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)  
- Servo Motor  
- Breadboard & Jumper Wires  
- USB Cable  

## Working Principle
The ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo motor scans the environment by rotating through a fixed angle range. At each angle, distance measurements are calculated using echo time and transmitted to a PC via serial communication. Processing visualizes this data as a real-time radar display.

## Applications
- Obstacle detection systems  
- Robotics and autonomous navigation  
- Radar concept demonstration  
- Educational embedded systems projects  

## Future Enhancements
- Increase detection range using advanced sensors  
- Wireless data transmission (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi)  
- 3D radar visualization  
- Integration with mobile or web-based interfaces
